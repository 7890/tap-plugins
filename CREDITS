The author would like to thank the following people for their help,
support, comments, suggestions, patches etc.

If you discover yourself in the following list and would like to
remain nameless instead, please write to the author. You will be
removed instantly.

In no particular order:


Anand Kumria <akumria@debian.org> constantly maintains a Debian
package of this software.

As the author of the lrdf library, Steve Harris <steve@plugin.org.uk>
was kind enough to take a look at the RDF file describing these
plugins.

Alexander Koenig <alex@lisas.de> discovered that the AutoPanner (and
Tremolo) didn't work at very small frequency values, and sent a patch
that became the base of the solution.

Forrest Cook <cook@lwn.net> suggested implementing an AutoPanner as a
new TAP-plugin.

Nick Lamb <njl98r@ecs.soton.ac.uk> suggested using his Demolition
[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~njl98r/code/ladspa/] program to
sanity-check the TAP-plugins. Demolition proved essential, a must for
every LADSPA plugin developer. It revealed bugs and LADSPA
non-conformancies too many to mention in the TAP-plugins code, which
could be fixed right away.



And, of course, special thanks to the Ardour [http://ardour.org] and
JACK [http://jackit.sf.net] development teams for their tireless
efforts in creating the Linux audio engineering platform (and besides
that, the recommended host for these plugins). TAP-plugins aims to be
a very small contribution to this effort.

If you discover yourself in the following list and would like to
remain nameless instead, please write to the author. You will be
removed instantly.



Anand Kumria <akumria@debian.org> constantly maintains a Debian
package of this software.

As the author of the lrdf library, Steve Harris <steve@plugin.org.uk>
was kind enough to take a look at the RDF file describing these
plugins.

Alexander Koenig <alex@lisas.de> discovered that the AutoPanner (and
Tremolo) didn't work at very small frequency values, and sent a patch
that became the base of the solution.

Forrest Cook <cook@lwn.net> suggested implementing an AutoPanner as a
new TAP-plugin.



And, of course, special thanks to the Ardour [http://ardour.org]
development team for their tireless efforts in creating *the* Linux
audio engineering platform (and the recommended host for these
plugins). TAP-plugins aims to be a very small contribution to this
effort.

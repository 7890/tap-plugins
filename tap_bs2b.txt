Usage Tips:

The crossfeed selection choices from several crossfeed values. From low to high, higher settings will bring the stereo field more in front of you.
Crossfeed 2 and 3 seem to remove high frequency information. So higher is not always better. 
Default is 1, because it seems the safest default.

HardRT=yes
run_adding=yes
